This is a port of [jquery-hashchange](https://github.com/chrisleishman/jquery-hashchange) to the [Kynetx Rules Language](http://docs.kynetx.com/). Many thanks to Phil Windley for describing how to build a single page interface in [KBlog: Making the Back Button Work](http://www.windley.com/archives/2011/04/kblog_making_the_back_button_work.shtml).
